# Unclosed HTML Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed tag.  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and validation errors in web browsers.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected version.

This is a simple example, but the principle applies to all HTML tags.  Always ensure that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag.
